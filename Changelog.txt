A BOT THAT ACTUALLY DOES STUFF!
Features Include:

Things that are contained inside moderation powers:
	Language moderation (no swear words)

Connects to a channel
Can read certain commands (and can have owner / mod priority)
Adding mods specific to the bot (owner only command, if you only trust some mods with this)

So far thats about it, but the code overheap was huge.
