# Proposal: Twitch Chat Bot
## A bot that will read chat, and reply or act accordingly.
Noah Guidara

## Needs and Opportunities
With Twitch.tv becoming larger every day, there is an increasingly large need for moderator bots that make the chat experience better. A Twitch chat bot can timeout spam, blacklisted words, or even set up a contest or game that viewers can participate in.

## Audience / Clients / Users
The audience I am trying to produce for are streamers, people who stream live on Twitch, and the viewers of those streamers.

## Product
The final product will be a Twitch chat bot that can determine things from what people say in the chat. From this, it will analyze commands and output words or actions. The bot can also be edited for whom the streamer is, allowing it to become anti-troll, or even more troll.

## Timeline
Most of the timeline is me trying to learn and understand the mechanics of how Twitch chat works, what a TCP client is and how it helps, and how I'm going to implement the methods and variables needed to store and output information.

| Date          | Deliverable   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| February 19   | Working Bot   |
| March 11      | Commands Work |
| April 1       | Moderates Chat|
| April 22      | Interactive   |
| May 13        | Finished Bot  |

## Reality Check
Creating a twitch chat bot is nothing new. Many people have created innovating bots that already do what I have proposed, and making my bot better than others requires days of hard work.

## Conclusion
I am obsessed with Twitch. It's a great streamer-viewer interactive website where you can say things you couldn't say without looking embarrassed in public. That anonymity is great, but it also needs to be moderated. With a large chat, doing this manually is tiring, that is the purpose of this bot.
